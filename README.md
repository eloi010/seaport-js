- üè∞ Openfort accounts

## How to run locally

**1. Clone the sample repository**

```console
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:openfort-xyz/samples.git
cd seaport-js
```

**2. Install all dependencies**

```console
npm i
```

**3. Run the Openfort test**

The current sample is using a local hardhat network to deploy and interact with Seaport and Openfort contracts.
The test starts creates a testing NFT (testErc721) and a testing ERC20s (testErc20).
Then, it uses an Openfort account to publish an offer to purchase a given testErc721 for 10 testErc20s.
In order to publish such offer, it needs to be signed by the owner of the openfort account (`orderSigner` in the test).
Finally, the owner of the NFT fulfills the offer.

```console
npx hardhat test test/create-order-openfort.ts
```
